funtionality:


this is a digital clock app that displays time in real time,
first we declare a function called displayTime, then we  create a variable dateTime with the Date object assigned to it, this provides us with an object template for the clock, then we manipulate this object using the other variables
that were declared, and if statement is used to indictae whether it is day time or night time, a set interval method is used to update the clock in real time.
